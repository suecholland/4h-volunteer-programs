        home base for future 4‑H projects.

      </p>

      <h2>Program Locations</h2>
      <p>
        Programs are typically held at the local Farm Bureau facility. Some sessions may also take place at my home, depending on the activity and availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        All locations are selected with youth safety, supervision, and appropriate facilities in mind. Specific location details will always be shared with parents or guardians in advance.
